Suppose we have an object with parameter

Example 

const moin = { name = "moin",age=22,"city": "bangalore"}

const {name,age,city} = moin

Now we need to access name,age,city in another object


we can easily do that 

const fullobj = {name : name, age:age,city:city}
     or
const shortobj = { name,age,city}
